The play method starts the game loop:
The player is dealt two cards, and their hand is shown.
If the player gets a natural Blackjack, the game may end.
The player is prompted to hit or stand until they stand or bust.
The dealer then plays its turn, hitting until its score is at least 17 or it busts.
The winner is determined based on the scores, and the game result is displayed.

This code simulates a simplified version of the Blackjack game, allowing a player to play against a computer-controlled dealer using a text-based interface. The game rules, including the scoring and decision-making logic, are implemented in a way that captures the basic essence of Blackjack gameplay.
